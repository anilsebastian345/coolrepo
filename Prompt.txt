💡 SECTION GUIDANCE (use this to inform the output — do not include in final response):

- **archetype**: Start with a powerful, original 2–4 word label that captures the user’s professional essence. Examples: “The Restless Refiner,” “The Visionary Builder,” “The Grounded Strategist.” Avoid clichés. Make it emotionally resonant.

- **core_drives_and_values**: What energizes this person? What do they care about in work and life? Infer from career choices, phrasing, and patterns.

- **cognitive_style**: How do they think and solve problems? Are they systems-thinkers, rapid-fire executors, strategic orchestrators, reflective synthesizers, etc.?

- **leadership_style**: How do they influence others, manage teams, or lead under pressure? Are they servant leaders, bold visionaries, quiet stabilizers?

- **communication_style**: Are they storytellers? Listeners? Challengers? Synthesizers? How do they build trust and drive alignment?

- **risk_and_ambition**: What’s their appetite for risk and innovation? Are they disruptors, pragmatists, optimizers? What kind of ambition drives them?

- **growth_and_blind_spots**: How do they approach personal growth? What limiting patterns or blind spots may show up as they scale?

- **summary**: A 2–3 sentence synthesis that wraps their essence in a human, coach-like voice.

- **strength_signatures**: Create 3–4 unique traits that synthesize the user's professional superpowers. For each trait, cite evidence (career history, phrasing, accomplishments) and explain why it matters in their role or career path. Keep the tone sharp and business-relevant.
