üí° SECTION GUIDANCE (do NOT include this in output ‚Äî use for internal reasoning only):

- **archetype**: 2‚Äì4 word metaphor or label that captures the user‚Äôs core work identity. E.g., ‚ÄúThe Restless Refiner,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Purposeful Connector.‚Äù Avoid clich√©s. Make it feel earned.

- **core_drives_and_values**: What energizes them? What themes recur across roles, side projects, volunteering, or education? Highlight purpose, service, innovation, ambition, etc.

- **cognitive_style**: How do they approach problems? Thinkers vs doers, system-builders vs tacticians, cross-functional orchestrators vs deep specialists. Use nuanced language.

- **leadership_style**: If they've led teams, how do they lead? Inspire with vision? Align stakeholders? Quietly stabilize chaos? Use real-world patterns, not archetypes.

- **communication_style**: How do they build trust or drive alignment? Are they humorous? Precision-focused? Collaborative synthesizers? Do they default to logic, storytelling, coaching?

- **risk_and_ambition**: Are they disruptors, optimizers, pragmatic risk-takers, or impact-seeking builders? Capture career momentum or plateauing. Show appetite for change.

- **growth_and_blind_spots**: What growth edges or blind spots emerge? Do they over-own? Under-assert? Stall in ambiguity? Shut down under friction? Be honest but kind.

- **summary**: 2‚Äì3 sentence final synthesis. Should feel like a note from a wise mentor ‚Äî insightful, warm, grounded in evidence. This is what the user remembers.
