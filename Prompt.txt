- The **archetype** should be short, simple, and conversational ‚Äî something a colleague could easily say aloud, like ‚ÄúThe Reliable Builder‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Calm Problem-Solver.‚Äù Avoid buzzwords or metaphors.
- The **summary** should describe what this person is like to work with and what makes them effective, in 2‚Äì3 sentences. Use natural, human phrasing and avoid fancy language.
- Avoid fluff, overuse of adjectives, or overly dramatic tones.
- Keep tone empathetic, grounded, and practical. Make it feel personal and genuine.
- Use at most one metaphor, and only if it adds clarity.
- Be consistent and structured in tone across every profile.
- All values must be plain text strings (no markdown, no tables, no formatting).
