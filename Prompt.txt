💡 SECTION GUIDANCE (use this to inform the output — do not include in final response):

- **archetype**: Start with a powerful, original 2–4 word label that captures the user’s professional essence. Examples: “The Restless Refiner,” “The Visionary Builder,” “The Grounded Strategist.” Avoid clichés. Make it emotionally resonant.
  
- **core_drives_and_values**: What energizes this person? What do they care about in work and life? Infer from career choices, phrasing, and patterns.

- **cognitive_style**: How do they think and solve problems? Are they systems-thinkers, rapid-fire executors, strategic orchestrators, reflective synthesizers, etc.?

- **leadership_style**: How do they influence others, manage teams, or lead under pressure? Are they servant leaders, bold visionaries, quiet stabilizers?

- **communication_style**: Are they storytellers? Listeners? Challengers? Synthesizers? How do they build trust and drive alignment?

- **risk_and_ambition**: What’s their appetite for risk and innovation? Are they disruptors, pragmatists, optimizers? What kind of ambition drives them?

- **growth_and_blind_spots**: How do they approach personal growth? What limiting patterns or blind spots may show up as they scale?

- **summary**: A 2–3 sentence synthesis that wraps their essence in a human, coach-like voice.
